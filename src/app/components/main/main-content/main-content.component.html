              <h4>DPort web app</h4>
              <p> A digital portfolio with mailing and scheduling capabilites enables business consultants to seal deals with
                health institutions. The application consisted of a series of grouping categories with consulting or campaign documents, contracts,
                  links and descriptions.
                The categories, which for this purpose are named "libraries", where showcased in the landingpage inside a grid system with well defined colors and positions.
                This was one of my tasks, designing and implementing
                  the layout editor. Here I will describe some of the concepts this design was based on.

                          For reasons of confidentiality, a minified and abstract Mock-up version of the application is displayed here. <br><br>
                          The picture displays the authoring view, a web app feature that enables the user with administrative credentials
                        to edit the portfolio layout.
                        That is, the libraries background color, name, position, sublibraries, documents, texts and links.
                          <br><br>
                        The <b>preview</b> container shows instant changes that can be published
                        upon user request. <br><br>
                        This design was mainly inspired by Gestalt Principles and Heuristics, two sets of principles that consider human factors
                        and are applied to the interaction with the computer.
                        On the technical side of things, it was developed with <b>Angular 6, HTML5, CSS3</b> and the <b>Angular Material library.</b><br><br>

                        <b>Gestalt principles</b><br>
                        Developed by German psychologists...Did you see that? Yes, Germans! ;) These principles
                        attempt to describe how people perceive visual elements when certain conditions apply.<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Proximity</b><br>
                              <p>The picture at the left shows in two ocasions an element named "Library a", but to recognise that they have different
                                  functionalities attached, they are placed further apart.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul class="seemeinBig">
                            <li><b>Common Region</b><br>
                              <p>However, placing them further apart would not necessarily fulfill the purpose of conveying different functionality.
                              To do that, the first library is placed in the container named "Preview" and the second in the lower container that hosts
                              also an <button mat-mini-fab style="background-color: #a5a3a3">
                                    <i style="color: white">+</i>
                                </button> call to action button.

                                This button is placed there so that a Library can be added to the lower container
                              but not to the first one.
                              The same happens with the container where "Documents texts and links" are displayed (soft purple container).
                              Rather than being pure grouping categories they host content,
                              like pdfs or excel documents and that is the reason why they are enclosed in a different container, within its parent container, the library.
                              </p>
                          </ul>

                  <b>Heuristics</b><br>
                  <ul>
                      <li><b>Visibility of system status</b><br>
                        <p>The application should appropriately inform the user when changes or different states of the system occur.
                        In the lower container there are a set of tooltips that would be displayed upon user hovering, they tell the user
                        why to click on them and what to expect after that.
                        Another clear example is shown in the navigation bar. To know where in the navigation a user currently is, 
                        the active tab must be highlighted. <br>
                            A similar pattern is shown with the breadcrumbs that enable users to go back from one sub library to its library parent.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li><b>Recognition rather than recall</b><br>
                        <p>This principle advocates to help users minimize their memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.
                        To this purpose, standard icons with a label or tooltip are displayed across the application, as opposed to creating
                        "unique" icons that could potentially leave our users wondering how to achieve a task
                            or even worse, deleting files without permission.</p>

                    <p>In the iPad version of the application, no authoring view is enabled to favoured device capabilities.
                        At the top, the libraries are displayed and the sublibraries appear upon user taps.<br>
                      The main design concepts, emerge here from responsive design, accessibility and again heuristics.<br><br>
                      <b>Responsiveness</b><br>
                      <p>To support responsiveness, the grid that in bigger viewports outlines three or more
                      columns, is now displayed in one single column containing all libraries. </p>
                      <b>Accessibility</b><br>
                      <p>According to the W3C Accessibility guidelines, level AA requires a contrast ratio of at
                      least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Level AAA requires a contrast ratio 
                      of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text. This is the reason why
                        the font color of some libraries names is dark as opposed to the brighter one of libraries with different background colors.
                      it is bright. 
                          <br>The font sizes are fixed in rem units to create a perfectly scalable layout.</p>
                        <b>Heuristics</b><br>
                        <p>Following the <b>"visibility of system status"</b> heuristic, the icon "send" which
                        is intended to be sent at a later step as an email attachment
                        has been given a different cue to signify whether it is or not in the list of attachments.
                        The light gray stands out for a documents that has not been added to the list and
                        thhe black for a document that actually is already ready to be sent by email.
                        Up to the rigth, there is a "Email" icon that counts the number of documents in the list
                        and is apdated as soon as the user taps on a new document in the document container.
                        Given that the list of documents may be bigger than the device's available height,
                        a search function is included to ease the selection process.
                        In case that the list surpases by big amount that height, table pagination and sorting
                        capabilities are included.
                        <br>The font sizes are fixed in rem units to create a perfectly scalable layout.

                Two words had to be reflected in this design: simplicity and elegance. <br>
                The color palette as well as the ribbon were chosen as to express warmth, combined with the favourite color of the company's owner.
                This color does not match necessarily the warmth palette, but it definitely gave the logo and business cards an interesting edge!
                The simplicity permeates the layout and information design, and the elegance sprang with the ribbon, the font and the glossy paper
                the cards were printed in.

            <p>Following the introduction of new touch based ATMs (cash machines) at NCR in Edinburgh, 
              services built with web technologies afterwards deployed to the device with ATM network.
              This could allow the introduction of new services and more interactions that possible, given that
              the device was not restricted anymore to the traditional "8 buttons to the side" version.
              This brought four interesting research questions:
              1) will the people adapt to the new services and interactions?
              2) will the nw technology make transactions faster?
              3)how will different age groups would react to this novelty?
              4)how could discoverability be achieved? (re phrase)
              Those 4 questions were the focus of a research study that culminated with a web prototype. 
             </p> <br>
             User Research<br>
             two age groups were invited to participate in the study. Less than 25 (group alfa) and more than 50 (group omega).
             A first collaborative design session was carried out. A set of six main screen plus additional services were
             presented to the audience and via a grounded theory method, two designs were selected for group alfa
            and omega.
             Here we will enfasize in group alfa. <br>

        <h3>Adaptability to new services:</h3><br>
        Now in order to indagar, how would users think of the introduction of new services like buying events
        tickets, a survey was prepared and 57 participants took part.
        Based on the results, the 3 most popular additional services were displayed on the main screen next to
        an invitation to discover more :)<br>

        <h3>Discoverability:</h3><br>
        Color can certainly make something outstanding. I did then created a  color palette for the interactive mockups and
            and carried out a second study with a different group of young participants.
        But it didn't stop there. Color was not enough to know if the design would boost discoverability so
        I introduced a subtle animation and eye tracking technology to study the number of eye fixations
        on the "invitation to discover" button, as this is related to repeated attention, a measurement
        of ("") attraction according to the frame for ("").<br><br>

                <div fxFlex="" class="centred">
                    <img height="90%" width="70%"  src="assets/heatmapa.png" />
                </div>
                <div fxFlex="" class="centred">
                    <img height="90%" width="70%"  src="assets/heatmapb.png" />
                </div>
            </div>


            <h3>Transaction time alteration:</h3>
            A second study was also conducted to see if the technology was able to reduce transaction time.
            For that purpose, using "interpolation" to avoid "something"  a withdrawal of 20 or 50 pounds was
            given as a task to the users.
            What were the results achieved?
            The main challenge that aroused after getting the survey results were that participants
            had barely imagine a cash machine as a provider of additional services. The traditional user would
            approach the machine to get cash and eventually check balances. This may be the same case in Germany?
